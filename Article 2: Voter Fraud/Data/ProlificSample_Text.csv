This can include individuals casting ballots despite knowing they're ineligible, as you mentioned, as well as other forms of manipulation like ballot stuffing, where multiple ballots are submitted by a single person, and misrecording of votes, where votes are intentionally recorded incorrectly ¹.

I also think about the potential consequences of voter fraud, such as undermining the trust of citizens in the democratic process and potentially altering the outcome of elections. Furthermore, voter fraud can take many forms, including disenfranchisement, where certain groups of people are prevented from voting, and vote buying, where individuals are paid to vote in a particular way ¹.

Overall, voter fraud is a serious issue that can have significant consequences for the integrity of elections and the democratic process as a whole.","Voter fraud can occur in various ways during an election. Electoral Fraud Methods include:

- Voter Impersonation: individuals casting ballots despite knowing they're ineligible ¹
- Ballot Stuffing: submitting multiple ballots by a single person ¹
- Disenfranchisement: preventing certain groups from voting through various means, such as voter ID laws or misinformation ¹
- Misrecording of Votes: altering votes or totals, either manually or electronically ¹
- Misleading or Confusing Ballot Papers: using design or other features to confuse voters into voting for a different candidate ¹
- Destruction of Ballots: destroying ballots for an opposing candidate or party ¹
- Invalidation of Ballots: making it appear that a voter has spoiled their ballot, rendering it invalid ¹
- Vote Buying: exchanging money, goods, or services for votes ¹
- Intimidation: using coercion or threats to influence voters ¹
